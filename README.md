# Simple Chatting Program 
This is a simple program of TCP connection as a chatting server by Socket Programming, where multiple clients may join and chat with each other.


<br>

## Getting Started
This program includes only two main files, which are:
- ```Server.py```: the main scripting file to run as a server.
- ```Client.py```: the client/user that will be connecting to the server to join the chatting room.


<br>

## Usage
1. Run the server file ```Server.py```.
2. Now the server is listening to the port waiting for users to join the chat room.
3. Run the client file ```Client.py```.
4. Now, you can see that the client has joined the chat room and you may start typing/chatting

#### Important Note: 
It's important to mention that following the previous steps will create only one single user in the chat room. To have multiple users as a chat group, run the ```Client.py``` file multiple times simultaneously and join the server with each of them. Enjoy! :grin:
